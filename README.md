# Hurricanes-Analysis
Codecademy Python Dictionaries Challenge Project

The purpose of this project was "to write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 hurricanes." Category 5 hurricanes are "the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed." Throughout this project, I used various techniques for manipulating and organizing the data to extract meaning from them.
